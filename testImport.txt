platform built for recommending music and streamlining supporting artists

Recommends songs from all over music, not limited to what you own/have access to. Has in depth music recommendation, playlist building, social aspects, and p2p music recommendation. Recommendation algorithms built on artists and users input on what songs, artists, and albums are similar.

Allow users to add links between songs, artists, and musicians. Use these connections to build playlists and recommend songs and artists. Allow users to define who they want to see more: big or small artist, etc. 

make importing Spotify playlists trivially easy. Make onboarding as easy as possible. Also maybe make it so you can export playlists to Spotify?

API built for plugging into a music library to play songs from the library. Won’t play songs you don’t have in your librsry. Idea is use it to find songs, have a tool go and pirate those songs, then play them.

How it supports musicians: allow the user to donate an amount of money and have that split among payments to the artists they are listening to. If you want to donate to a specific artist, do that. If you want to donate according to how much you listen to artists, do that. Say top 5, 10, 50 artists by song plays.

Features like day lists, radios, playlists based on one or multiple songs, etc
