The "LLM-Agents-System" concept envisions a network of specialized AI agents orchestrated by a central "Reign of Winter" component. Individual agents like "MIST" (Modular Integrated Services and Technology), and "David" would handle specific tasks, with potential for varied personalities and shared functionality. A key feature under consideration is an agent capable of collating and summarizing research/news feeds. Development aims for a modular design, potentially utilizing a central terminal UI and a lightweight routing model to manage agent interaction and independent UI development. MIST is intended as a unified framework with agent-side modularity, including file writing, organization within topic folders, and generation of aggregate note files.
