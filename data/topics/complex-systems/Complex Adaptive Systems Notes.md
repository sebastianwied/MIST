- Bees huddling based on genetic diversity is interesting!
- Interesting question! Can we classify agents into prototypical agents from which larger scale systems are quantified?
  - Maybe attach properties to a set of base classes?
- ```"We know that adaptive agents alter the world in which they live. What we do not know is how much agent sophistication is required to do so effectively and what other conditions are necessary for this to happen. In general, the link between agent sophistication and system outcome is poorly understood. Theoretical work in economics suggests that optimizing agents out for their own benefit can, without intention, lead a market system toward efficiency under the right conditions. Moreover, experimental and computational work suggests that such outcomes are possible even with nonoptimizing agents. Ultimately, it would be nice to have a full characterization of the interplay between adaptation and optimality in social systems.” (P29)```. This seems applicable to my prisoners’ dilemma stuff!
- ```"The idea of social niche construction is also important. Agents, by their activities, can often alter the world they inhabit and, by so doing, form new niches. For example, the development of membranes early in the history of life on Earth allowed various biological components to bind together and isolate themselves from the external world. This fundamentally altered their local environment creating new opportunities for interacting with the world. Similarly, the formation of merchant guilds, corporations, and political organizations fundamentally altered both the internal world faced by agents and the external world in which these new entities operated. We would like to know when and how agents construct such niches.” (P29)```
