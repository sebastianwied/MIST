# Directions from here
- Looking at when cooperative behavior can emerge from noise initial conditions
- Can I prove that a round robin with cells updating strategies is the same as a fully connected network spawning more children? All thats changing is the probability of an agent interacting with an agent of a specific type.
- Look at papers citing axelrod 1981 and see what open questions there are on emergence and initial viability as keywords, filter by relatively high citations
- Discretize the m1 strategy space into a lattice to control how discrete the strategy space is
- Equivalences galore!
- Check textbooks
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complexity_of_Cooperation
- Try to answer *one* question in a paer. What am I trying to answer?
- Implement a discounting parameter to control probability interaction ends after this round.
