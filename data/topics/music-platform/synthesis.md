This music platform aims to provide a comprehensive music discovery and listening experience centered around advanced recommendations and artist support. Key features include a broad music library recommendation engine based on user and artist-defined similarities, social features, and peer-to-peer recommendations. Users can connect songs and artists, customize their discovery preferences (e.g., prioritizing smaller artists), and easily import/export playlists from/to Spotify. The platform offers multiple listening formats (day lists, radio, playlists), and includes a unique direct artist support system allowing users to donate to artists based on listening habits or individual preference. An API enables integration with local music libraries, although a controversial idea exists to facilitate song acquisition outside of official channels.
