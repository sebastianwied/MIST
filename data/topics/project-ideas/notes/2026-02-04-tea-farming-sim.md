# BRAINSTORMING

## Elevator pitch

A cozy tea farming game set in ancient China built around farming and creating new teas, running a tea shop, and developing relationships with the villagers. 

## Farm, tea, and economy

The core of the gameplay is built around the farm, in which farming tea is the core component. While other crops can be grown, their main purpose is to help make special teas.

- In depth tea farming and processing mechanics. Properties of tree(which harvest, how old the tree is, sunlight on the tree, etc…), how you process it(cooking it, fermenting it, drying it, etc…), other ingredients you combine with the tea (fruits etc…). Properties of all the different ingredients and steps play together to create an enormous variety of tea options. Ideally without me having to program them all. Can add ingredients part way through to change what the tea does, can change how you process it (move from aging above ground to below ground for example) DO RESEARCH ON TEA FARMING!
- Dont have a bajillion crops that all do the same thing! Every crop besides the tea should do something notable and interesting. Pacha struggles with this, the crops are kind of all the same except for the name and look, and if the plant regrows or not. I can’t really distinguish them. Every crop should be distinct and memorable.
- Tea not sold in the tea house is sold to traveling merchants coming through town. Tea can also be sold in the tea house for higher prices than selling to merchants, but takes more time to sell. Merchants come through town not all the time. Merchants let you sell off bigger amounts of tea.
- To prevent min-maxing and encourage breadth instead of making your farm all one crop there are in-depth economy mechanics - supply and demand affect prices of teas, higher value teas are harder to sell, certain teas and combinations with addins can fluctuate the price of tea depending on local or global trends, etc… Imperial decrees :D
Gave supply and demand figures hidden, maybe have demand be hinted at through interaction with NPCs and like “newspapers” idk what the equivalent would be but like imperial decrees or the tastes of nobles affecting what people find popular.
Wouldn’t like punish the player because then you just wait to sell those teas until its back in swing at which point they will be more valuable because they will have aged
- Aging teas depends on location too! Can age things in the air vs in caves for different effects on the teas!
- Livestock maybe, pets definitely
- Bees!

## Tea shop

Separate from the tea farm, the player also runs a tea shop in which they sell teas they grow and dishes cooked from ingredients bought from the village. The tea shop is a gathering place for NPCs from the village and visitors. The tea shop is only open on days the player wants it to be open giving players a break from the farm and giving them something to do.

- The tea shop is a significant place where tea is sold and money is made. You sell to villagers and people passing through town.
- Have cool tea shop mechanics too! Let you customize it, the menu, hire someone, etc… Crops for dishes are bought from NPCs in town, removing the need to farm a bunch of dishes and letting you explore cooking more. Removes the need for you to grow everything yourself and lets you explore the cooking and shop-running.
- Make the tea house feel important in the town! Events happen there, people are happy when its open, etc. This should make it less onerous to develop relationships with people. You can give them some free tea as a gift to help your relationship with them, you can talk to people from the town, talk to people coming through town.
- Fishing for tea house dishes! Tea should be the main thing you sell, the rest shouldn’t be a money making method. They should feed into dishes in the tea house which in turn make money, but they shouldn’t be something you just go fishing for a day and sell it all to make a bunch of money

## Setting, Village, and NPCs

- Set in ancient china/korea/japan. Set in a mountain village.
- Interact with the NPCs and romance them! Help contribute to the health of the town like in stardew.
- Interactions with NPCs should feel meaningful! You can learn about their family, their friends, their life, etc. Romancing has noticeable impacts on your relationship! Getting to know people more or trying to romance them has them visiting your shop more, coming to say hi, giving you things, etc.
- Would be cool to have visitors stop by your tea shop when its open and maybe buy rarer and more interesting teas. Would be cool to try to have interesting dialogue options with them.
- Relationships shouldn’t feel like you are buying it. And it should be able to feel different if you are trying to romance them or befriend them
- NPCs have dynamic schedules. They have things they want do in a day, and do those things. Their schedule can adapt based on events that happen(especially the tea shop opening!)

## Player

- Have lots of room for expression! Maybe tea packaging, tea house, your house, your clothes, etc. Cosmetics should NOT be a grind to get! It should not be trivial, you shouldn’t be able to buy a million things at once but at the same time it shouldnt be onerous to express yourself. Other things provide a tangible reward for purchasing it or upgrading but for cosmetics it can feel restrictive and like well i could put these resources to something else. It shouldn’t be a limited currency or something either. Maybe NPC gifts could be special cosmetics! Have like a closet where you can try clothes on easily without having to drag things all over. Have a clothing shop where you can try things on!
- Getting tripped up by lots of things on the ground is annoying. Some things should definitely stop you, but it should be a limited list
- Tall objects go transparent when near them, not just behind them.

## Other areas

- Mining is a thing for underground fungi, materials for structures and things to help with the processing, and irrigation.
- Foraging is maybe a thing too for more exotic teas.

## Mechanics, Difficulty, and Vibe

- Cozy, relaxing game. In depth mechanics but should have a ramp into the complexity and it shouldn’t be overwhelming. You should be able to play the game perfectly fine without understanding nuances of how everything works. As you learn more you will be able to more finely control the tea you make, but there is nothing stopping a beginner from picking up the game.
- Try to make it so the player always feels like they know of something to do other than trying to idly make money. Like in roots of pacha its like i dont know what to do let me just fish. Ideally tea shop helps with this?
- Having a mess of tools isnt great - pacha and stardew both struggle with this, dont really like this part of mining and clearing plants and stuff. Maybe just attacking tree with any tool equipped switches to the right one
- I want the player to feel a sense of discover and mastery as they learn the mechanics behind the farming.
- More interesting inventory mechanics than just x slots for y stacks of items. I don’t like having to manage my inventory, i prefer having interesting inventory mechanics. Toolbelt for tools, basket for harvesting tea and crops, more interesting storage than just some chests, etc. Mining bag for mining, etc. HOWEVER! Storage management shouldn’t be an issue. It shouldn’t be annoying trying to fit everything in chests or something. There are places for things, and they go there without restriction. Tea goes in the tea warehouse, crops and meat and fish go in the kitchen, mined goods go somewhere, materials go in material stores, etc… Fighting with number of slots pisses me OFF.
- Fun minigames! Not sure where or what they fit in to but minigames are fun
- Farming is partly optimization but also about learning how everything interacts and ties together. Maybe could have a logbook that auto fills or the user could fill in notes about things. The player should NOT be able to min-max! Or at least not very effectively.
- Save whenever and wherever!!
- Stamina feels like a weird mechanic, not a big fan
- No fighting
- The player needs to feel like they are contributing to the world and the farm all the time. Fighting accomplishes that but I dont want fighting. Tea shop can be part of this, but all the activities the player can do should feel *meaningful*
- Seasons dont mess things up as much as in some games. Shouldn’t be crazy pressure to plant crops on certain days or something. Seasons should make you do different crops but the tea should adapt to the seasons. Winter is a little different, but the other seasons should have interesting mechanics and the tea is persistent.
- MULTIPLAYER! Let you relax with someone! Voice chat in game? Coop mechanics built into the game not tacked on top. Like in pacha not letting you share a house for pets. Inventories not shared, but seeds are shared.
- No fail states. Tea can be mediocre but not like completely ruined for example.

## What makes other games great

# FEATURES/PLAN

- Movement:
    - By foot
        - Walking, diagonal supported
        - No running
        - Limit movement stopping due to items (make it not as extreme as pacha)
    - Mount?
- Inventory:
    - Tools
        - Player has a tool belt. Has dedicated slots for all tools in the game. However, shouldn’t need to look at this much because of the automatic tool switching (see interaction with world)
    - Log book
        - Automatically stores information about everything when knowledge is sufficiently explored. Ideally remove need for wiki. Make it easier to pick up where you left off.
        - Different sections for things like tea, people, crops, tech, general gameplay.
- Interaction with the world:
    - Using tools:
        - When clicking something that is interactable WHILE TOOL BELT EQUIPPED ONLY will automatically switch to the correct tool.
        - Right click to interact, left click to mine. I.e. a well will fill water bucket if right clicked, get mined if left clicked.
    - Planting tea and crops:
        - Tea is planted as a tree.
        - Crops grow as in other games, if it is a tree it is a tree like in real life(think stardew)
    - Picking tea and crops:
- Camera:
    - Display visible marker of which tile mouse is pointing at
    - Tall things go transparent when near them, not only behind them
- Appearance:
    - Cosmetics:
        - Clothes are gained through crafting, shopping, and as gifts from NPCs
        - Player has a closet in their house
    - Tea packaging
    - Decoration
- Player’s house:
    - Player sleeps here to pass the night
    - Pets are housed here
- Tea shop:
    - Player can decide at any point before noon to open the tea shop for the evening and before 10 to open starting at noon.
    - Selling things:
        - Player can sell tea they have to NPCs in the shop.
    - NPCs:
        - NPCs come to the tea shop based on their schedule and their relationship to player.
        - Visitors to town come to the tea shop if open. Good to align opening tea shop with visitors as they are bigger spenders(fancier teas sell quicker to them)
        - Can gift dishes to the NPCs
        - They order dishes off a menu you prepare?
        - Town is partly oriented around the tea shop, with the tea shop opening acting like mini events, with NPCs coming by. Provides an opportunity to talk to NPCs you have relationships with
- NPCs:
    - Dynamic schedules (more interesting than stardew maybe, can’t exactly predict where people will be, but should be easy to find where they are)
    - People in town talk about visitors coming a few days out from when they do. Maybe have it be a regular thing (every week?) as well as random.
- Mining:
- Progression:
- Crops:
    - Tea trees:
        - Takes a certain amount of time to grow to maturity, at which point you can pick leaves.
        - Leaf quality depends on:
            - Tree age
            - Tree conditions
            - Which harvest of the season/year, which is better?
    - Crops:
        - 
- Stamina
    - Rethink - should be a thing but it feels rather limiting in current renditions like in pacha and stardew.
- Saving:
    - Whenever player wants, don’t want to have to end the day to save.

- Kids age and are meaningful!
- YOU age! Time should feel like it passes. Could character die and pass farm to your kid?
- Temp buffs shouldnt be on a timer but based on how many times you use it
- 

Winter:

Maybe the player could go into the city to sell tea there and learn about tea cultivation by talking to people? If no farming happens in winter.
