Project ideas center on utilizing computational approaches to model complex systems. One explores a generative neural network for game playing, referencing specific research ("Bubble game Moinas and Pouget"), while another proposes modeling plasmodial slime mold using complex systems science. Both suggest applying advanced computational techniques to understand and simulate dynamic, potentially emergent behaviors.
