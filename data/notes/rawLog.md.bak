next features for the AI agent: consider reworking the note synthesis system. In order to allow for larger windows of stored information, maybe build a sort of idea index which points to specific files, then write longer things for each of those topics.

Also, want to add task and calendar functionality. Also add chatter, work on companion more, voice cloning of MIST, daily research/news feeds

I think making a whole network of agent tools like this that network together could be really cool. Name them after pantheon characters: MIST for notes, chande for science, etc.

and make a master agent which interacts with all of them. Maybe make it Caspian or Maddie
