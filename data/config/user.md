### Interests

*   Research environments
*   Space news
*   Plasmodial slime molds (Physarum Polycephalum)
*   Voice interaction
*   Companion app UI
*   Reading books
*   Note synthesis
*   Pantheon characters (e.g., MIST, Chande, Caspian, Maddie)

### Projects

*   Modeling the behavior of plasmodial slime molds (Physarum Polycephalum)
*   Agent interface improvements (REPL) - including colors, ASCII art, and Markdown file viewing.
*   Agent task/calendar functionality
*   Resynth feature (needs to handle long files)
*   Improving companion app UPI
*   Adding chatter
*   Book note taking
*   Note synthesis system rework (idea index pointing to files)
*   Editing md files in the mist repl app?
*   Network of agent tools (Mist, Chande, etc.) with a central organizer Reign of Winter.

### Goals

*   To have the AI agent collate news/research feeds into a daily summary (e.g., from Arxiv, space news sites, newsletters)
*   To improve the agent’s ability to respond personally to questions by maintaining a user information file.
*   To create a "cool" interface for task/calendar functionality.
*   Creating a system of agents which network together.
*   Setting up MIST for sending to mom.

### Preferences

*   Wants a REPL interface with nice colors and ASCII art.
*   Prefers to view Markdown files directly within the REPL interface.
*   Agent interactor platform called Reign of Winter.

### Usage

*   Testing chat saving functionality.
*   Exploring recall functionality.
*   Testing testing
*   List
*   Status line testing
*   Adding task (particle homework due this coming tuesday)
*   Aggregate note testing

### Notes

*   Flag messages as not notes to avoid adding to rawLog.
*   Need to handle long files in Resynth.
*   Consider reworking the note synthesis system to allow for larger windows of stored information, using an idea index pointing to specific files.
*   Want to add task and calendar functionality.
*   Also add chatter.
*   Work on companion app UPI.
*   Want to take notes on books.
*   Sometimes app gets slow.
*   Agent tools should be named after pantheon characters.

### Additional Details

*   Focus on color-coded notes.
*   Explore using a text editor like VS Code for note taking.
*   Consider adding a table of contents.
*   If possible, add a "last modified date" field to notes.
*   Suggest using a more efficient file format for long text files.
*   The REPL should be easily navigable using keyboard shortcuts.
*   The "idea index" should be easily visible.
*   Implement a "reset" button.
*   Add a "recent notes" section.

*   [2026-02-02T14:10:58] (note) for the agent project, maybe I should make a central terminal system I load up, and individual agents take over the receiving side of the ui. Maybe I can have a light model route things and have it automatically change who gets called. Make it easier to work on the agents and the ui differently

*   [2026-02-03T10:05:31] (note) MIST: Want it to be a unified framework I interact with. Heavily modular on the agent side. - [ ] Allow me to write whole files. Include these in the aggregate command but within each topic folder have a folder of my note files. The ai should organize all the files I write. It should also make a markdown file that’s just all the notes I’ve written thus far, separate from the synthesized file. - [ ] Optionally make other agent systems share or have separate personalities.
