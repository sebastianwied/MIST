--- CURRENT PROFILE ---
## Interests

*   Research environments
*   Space news
*   Plasmodial slime molds (Physarum Polycephalum)
*   Voice interaction
*   Companion app UI
*   Reading books
*   Note synthesis
*   Pantheon characters (e.g., MIST, Chande, Caspian, Maddie)

## Projects

*   Modeling the behavior of plasmodial slime molds (Physarum Polycephalum)
*   Agent interface improvements (REPL) - including colors, ASCII art, and Markdown file viewing.
*   Agent task/calendar functionality
*   Resynth feature (needs to handle long files)
*   Improving companion app UPI
*   Adding chatter
*   Book note taking
*   Note synthesis system rework (idea index pointing to files)
*   Editing md files in the mist repl app?
*   Network of agent tools (Mist, Chande, etc.) with a central organizer Reign of Winter.

## Goals

*   To have the AI agent collate news/research feeds into a daily summary (e.g., from Arxiv, space news sites, newsletters)
*   To improve the agent's ability to respond personally to questions by maintaining a user information file.
*   To create a "cool" interface for task/calendar functionality.
*   Creating a system of agents which network together.
*   Setting up MIST for sending to mom.

## Preferences

*   Wants a REPL interface with nice colors and ASCII art.
*   Prefers to view Markdown files directly within the REPL interface.
*   Agent interactor platform called Reign of Winter.

## Usage

*   Testing chat saving functionality.
*   Exploring recall functionality.
*   Testing testing
*   List
*   Status line testing
*   Adding task (particle homework due this coming tuesday)
*   Aggregate note testing

## Notes

*   Flag messages as not notes to avoid adding to rawLog.
*   Need to handle long files in Resynth.
*   Consider reworking the note synthesis system to allow for larger windows of stored information, using an idea index pointing to specific files.
*   Want to add task and calendar functionality.
*   Also add chatter.
*   Work on companion app UPI.
*   Want to take notes on books.
*   Sometimes app gets slow.
*   Agent tools should be named after pantheon characters.

[2026-02-01T18:00:08] (note) Long term, I want to make a system of agents which network together. Have each agent purpose built for specific tasks, have one centralizer route and manage them. Could name the organizer Reign of Winter and make some like MIST for notes, David for science stuff, etc...
